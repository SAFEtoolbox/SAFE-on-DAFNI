This folder contains all the files needed to (1) dockerise the HyMod model, (2) run it on DAFNI and (3) carry out a simple sensitivity analysis on the results. 

To Dockerside the model you need: 
1) The dockerfile
2) The requirements.txt file which is drawn on by the Dockerfile 
3) The scripts needed to run the model (run.py and HyMod.py) 

To upload and run the model on DAFNI you need:

2) The input data file LeafCatchment.txt

To carry out a simple sensiivity analysis the GSA_PAWN.ipynb can be run in the visualisation part of DAFNI.
