This repository collects code and documentation produced in the **USARIS project** (*Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis for resilient infrastructure systems*) under the DAFNI Centre of Excellence for Resilient Infrastructure Analysis (UKRI Building a Secure and Resilient World programme - grant number ST/Y003713/1)

**Project Description**

Computational modelling provides a vital tool to support infrastructure decisions, 
allowing to evaluate risks and benefits of different infrastructure options on a virtual system (or digital twin) 
before committing to a particular design. Model outputs though are conditional on a range of uncertain assumptions and input data, 
due to our incomplete or imperfect knowledge of the drivers and the properties of the system being modelled, and irreducible
uncertainty about how those drivers and properties may evolve in the future. 
Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis (UQ&SA) is a set of generic methods that can be used to analyse 
the propagation of uncertainties in model and thus improve the model's construction, validation, and use for decision-making under uncertainty. 
UQ&SA are "model-agnostic" methodologies, meaning that they are applicable to any mathematical model regardless of the specific application domain.
The goal of this project is to set the foundations for integrating UQ&SA functionalities in the DAFNI platform,
the UK *Data & Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure* (https://www.dafni.ac.uk/). 
Ultimately the project will contribute to enable and promote best practices for responsible modelling in the DAFNI users community.
