**USARIS: *Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis for resilient infrastructure systems***

Computational modelling provides a vital tool to support infrastructure decisions, 
allowing to evaluate risks and benefits of different infrastructure options on a virtual system (or digital twin) 
before committing to a particular design. Model outputs though are conditional on a range of uncertain assumptions and input data, 
due to our incomplete or imperfect knowledge of the drivers and the properties of the system being modelled.

Overconfidence in model results and insufficient consideration of the breath of possible futures is a key obstacle to infrastructure resilience. If models are used to inform large investment decisions, they must be trustworthy and defensible. Decision-makers need to be made aware of the uncertainties affecting model output(s) and the critical assumptions that define the scope of validity of the model. Also, as uncertainty about the future is irreducible, modelling for resilience should aim at identifying designs that achieve an acceptable performance across a wide range of future scenarios, rather than designs that are optimal under any particular scenario. Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis (UQ&SA) is a set of generic methods that can be used to analyse the propagation of uncertainties in model and thus improve the model's construction, validation, and use for decision-making under uncertainty. UQ&SA are "model-agnostic" methodologies, meaning that they are applicable to any mathematical model regardless of the specific application domain.

The goal of this project is to set the foundations for integrating UQ&SA functionalities in the DAFNI platform (https://www.dafni.ac.uk/), producing training materials for current and future DAFNI users to learn when and how to use UQ&SA, and developing recommendations for the DAFNI technical team on future developments needed in order to scale-up the applicability of UQ&SA to more complex models. Ultimately the project will contribute to enable and promote best practices for responsible modelling in the DAFNI users community.
